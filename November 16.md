# Design notebook for week ending November 16, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

Due to some frustrating technical issues, I wasn't able to get a PC working and running Spring. So, my hopes of
starting to design the actual IR and Spring AI implementation were unfulfilled. I planned in as much detail as
I could how the IR would work and plug into the Spring system, but without having Spring there isn't much
documentation about how AIs are actually implemented (how you get the information we let the users condition on,
how you decide to move and attack, etc.).

A file describing the plan for the IR is added to our documents folder. It feels a little trivial on the one hand,
basically just saying "we want to store what the user said" but I think that the IR is reasonably simple so
that's probably not too much of a bad thing. I still feel like I didn't explain myself very well though.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

Right now, I really need to get Spring working so that I can see how we will actually need to implement our AI.
I think once I have that up, and can get a default AI actually written and start making it behave as dictated in some
JSON file, progress will be pretty quick.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Can you think of a more efficient or cleaner way to represent the users input as a Java object?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

Especially in the design phase, it's hard to say exactly how much time I worked on the project. I'd say I spent about
six hours of dedicated "work on the project time", in addition to a fair amount of planning and thinking that
happened at pretty random times, as I just had a few spare minutes and took some time to think about the project.
Take that however you will.
