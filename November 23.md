# Design notebook for week ending November 23, 2014

## Description

This week, I focused on the parser for our language. After some frustration with installation and experimentation, I
have what I think is a pretty solid parser for our grammar generated by Grako from EBNF. Importantly, it uses named
rules to generate an easily interpreted AST (thanks Tyler!), so I'm optimistic that it will be pretty doable to get
the verification of IQ requirements and to interpret the JSON in the Spring AI file. Another significant portion of
my time was spent trying to get my PC set up with Spring (successful) and Java and Eclipse (not so successful).
Hopefully, that will eventually work so that I can actually work on AI stuff.
An EBNF file and the generated Python parser are both in our documents, along with a skeleton AI file that a user
would use to write their AIs. Additionally, the file sampleOutput.txt shows what running the parser on a little
baby AI definition looks like. After user testing, I hope to figure out exactly what we should put into a helpful
user guide that explains in the simplest way what things a user can say and exactly how IQ works.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The biggest issue now will be going from the AST JSON representation to something that an AI file in Java within
the Spring framework can use to make decisions.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

What things would you consider essential to help users learn the syntax for our language? What do you think the best
way to communicate what you can and can't say is?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent 9-9.5 hours on the project this week. I focused my efforts on getting Grako to actually generate a parser,
while Alex focused on getting the basics of getting a game with units working (and it works! Hooray! Spring is crazy,
as it turns out).
