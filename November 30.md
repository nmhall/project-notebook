# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

I did basically no work on the project this week due to Thanksgiving break. I plan to work a whole bunch this week
to compensate for that.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

Right now, the most pressing issue is to get a workable demo, I think. We need to clean up the language after
receiving some really good feedback, and get the AI into a slightly more working state.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Do you have any suggestions for programs in our language that would make good examples that show the behavior
our language allows well?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent about an hour on the project this week due to Thanksgiving break. Alex worked a whole bunch on the AI.
